## Project Overview
This project involves the exploration of [describe the purpose of the dataset, e.g., "sales data for a retail company" or "customer data for a marketing analysis"]. The goal of the project is to perform a thorough EDA, which includes understanding the distributions, correlations, and detecting any anomalies or outliers.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is [briefly describe the dataset, its source, and any important attributes]. It includes the following columns:
- **Column 1**: [Description of column 1]
- **Column 2**: [Description of column 2]
- **Column 3**: [Description of column 3]
- ...
- **Column N**: [Description of column N]

The dataset can be found in the `data/` folder of this repository.

## Key Steps in EDA
1. **Data Cleaning**: We checked for missing values, duplicated entries, and handled data imbalances.
2. **Statistical Summary**: Basic statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation were computed for the numerical features.
3. **Data Visualization**: Various plots, such as histograms, boxplots, and pair plots, were used to visualize the distributions and relationships between features.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: We analyzed the correlation between numerical variables using a heatmap.
5. **Outlier Detection**: Outliers were identified using statistical methods like Z-scores and visualized with boxplots.

## Tools & Libraries
This analysis was done using the following tools and libraries:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations

## Results
The results of the EDA can be found in the Jupyter Notebook `notebooks/EDA.ipynb`. The key findings from the analysis include:
- [Key finding 1]
- [Key finding 2]
- [Key finding 3]
- ...

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the EDA has provided a deep understanding of the dataset, identified key patterns, and highlighted areas for further analysis. The next steps in this project could involve building predictive models or refining the data for more advanced analyses.

## Future Work
- Further analysis using machine learning models to predict [target variable].
- Handling missing values using more advanced techniques.
- Performing feature engineering for better model performance.
